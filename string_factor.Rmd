## Mostly use string vectors

```{r}
string_vec = c("my", "name", "is", "Arwen")

str_detect(string_vec, "Arwen")
str_detect(string_vec, "e")

str_replace(string_vec, "Arwen", "")
str_remove(string_vec, "e")
```

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  "i think we all rule for participating",
  "i think i have been caught",
  "i think this will be quite fun actually",
  "it will be fun, i think"
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "^i think")  # ^ means start of the string
str_detect(string_vec, "i think$")  # $ means end of the string

str_remove(string_vec, "i think$")
```

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  "Time for a Pumpkin Spice Latte!",
  "went to the #pumpkinpatch last weekend",
  "Pumpkin Pie is obviously the best pie",
  "SMASHING PUMPKINS -- LIVE IN CONCERT!!"
  )

str_detect(string_vec,"[Pp]umpkin")
```

Let's get a bit more complicated

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  '7th inning stretch',
  '1st half soon to begin. Texas won the toss.',
  'she is 5 feet 4 inches tall',
  '3AM - cant sleep :('
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "^[0-9][a-zA-Z]")
```

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  'Its 7:11 in the evening',
  'want to go to 7-11?',
  'my flight is AA711',
  'NetBios: scanning ip 203.167.114.66'
  )

str_detect(string_vec, "7\\.1")
# . means anything (this is a special character),
# \ means the thing after is not a special character
```

## Factors

```{r}
vec_sex = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female"))

vec_sex = fct_inorder(vec_sex)
```
